Please find the minimum number of parentheses that need to be added to the string to make it valid ? Assume length of string is < 1000.

Find if a string has any duplicate characters. If so, please remove all duplicates ( Length of string < 1000).

Create a function "ReverseString" that accepts a string and number of times to reverse the string (N) . N < 1000, length of string <1000.

In an array of numbers, find the longest sorted (ascending order) array. Assume length of array < 1000 .

Write a function to count the number of nodes in a binary tree.
If they get it too easily: somebody came back and said your function crashes sometimes with a stack overflow. How could that happen? Fix it.
Extra credit: Make your function thread-safe.
